## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- 12 column grid

### What I learned

This is my first time working on transitions intentionally, I knew about transitions before but only to smooth out properties that are changed but now I undestand a lot more about it for its decorative purpose.

I understand the SCSS way of doing things better, and have created a mixin for fonts in a FrontEnd Mentor way along with a function to switch all these mixins depending on screensizes.

### Continued development

There are also things about grid that still confuses me, or I thought I understood but then proven wrong. Though it helps that I am encountering these problems now since the former assumptions were based on not having experienced the difficulties I just had. Though I am slowly getting better at it.

It also felt unintuitive to work on a BEM model becuase sometimes the naming just doesn't feel right. I also could not find reusable code where I should before I put them to code so refactoring does take extra steps. Learning how to see things ahead of time is something I would like to learn in the future.
